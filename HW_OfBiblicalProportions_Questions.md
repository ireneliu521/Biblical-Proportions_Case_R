Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this case, I will analyze the text of the bible with the following steps. I will first understand the structure of this bible text file and after some cleaning, I will create a wordcloud of the top 100 words in the bible. I will then further mood score the words and summarize the bible into less than 500 verses. Lastly, I will find the main 3 topics in the bible.

1: Store each verse in a text array. Print the top 20 verses below. (Remove the top two lines which contain the title.)

5: Lower case all text.
------------------------

``` r
bible<-tolower(bible)
```

6: Convert the text of all verses into a Corpus using the **tm** package.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
library(tm)
```

    ## Loading required package: NLP

``` r
bible_corpus<-Corpus(VectorSource(bible))
#print(bible_corpus)

7: Remove all punctuation. Use a corpus function for this. How many unique words are there in the bible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
removepun<-tm_map(bible_corpus,removePunctuation)
tdm1<-TermDocumentMatrix(removepun,control=list(wordLengths = c(1, Inf)))
print(nrow(tdm1))
```

    ## [1] 12689

8: Remove all stopwords. Now how many unique terms are there?
--------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
removestops<-tm_map(removepun,removeWords,stopwords("english"))
tdm2<-TermDocumentMatrix(removestops,control=list(wordLengths = c(1, Inf)))
print(nrow(tdm2))
```

    ## [1] 12569

9: Stem the text, to remove multiplicity of similar words of the same root.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
library(SnowballC)
stemmed<-tm_map(removestops,stemDocument)
print(stemmed)
```

    ## <<SimpleCorpus>>
    ## Metadata:  corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0
    ## Content:  documents: 31102

10: How many distinct words are there in the bible, after stemming?

``` r
tdm3<-TermDocumentMatrix(stemmed,control=list(wordLengths = c(1, Inf)))
print(nrow(tdm3))
```

    ## [1] 9143

11: Convert the TDM into a matrix and find the 50 most common words in the bible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
tdm4<-as.matrix(tdm3)
commonwords<-sort(rowSums(tdm4),decreasing=TRUE)
print(names(commonwords[1:50]))
```

    ##  [1] "shall"    "unto"     "lord"     "thou"     "god"      "thi"

    ## [49] "great"    "o"

12: Make a wordcloud of the top 100 words in the bible.
--------------------------------------------------------

``` r
library(wordcloud)
```

    ## Loading required package: RColorBrewer

``` r
top100<-sort(rowSums(tdm4),decreasing=TRUE)
wordcloud(names(top100[1:100]),top100)
```
Please refer to the Wordcloud of the top 100 words graph.
